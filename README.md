my portfolio written in react and mobx.

the portfolio is in WIP, but main features are implemented :

-the i18n
-main pages
-100% responsive, perfectly adapted for all kind of devices
-techselector for technologies for each projects.


things missing:

-most of the wording, planning to add it at the end after all design is finished.
-some of the design will be changed (mostly css)
-all buttons are not connected yet


how to run this:

clone it, run  npm install   and acces the home page at http://localhost:3000/home
